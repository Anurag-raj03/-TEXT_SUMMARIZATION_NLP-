## 🛠️ How It Works 🛠️
1. **Input Handling**: Users can either input text directly into a form or upload a PDF file.
2. **Text Processing**: The text is processed using various NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and ranking of sentences.
3. **Summarization**: Key points are extracted from the text and presented in a concise format.
4. **Display Results**: The summarized text is displayed on the web interface.

## 📝 Example Usage 📝

### Input Text:
```
Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that gives machines the ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human languages. It is a crucial technology behind many applications like chatbots, translation services, and voice-activated assistants.
```

### Output Summary:
```
NLP gives machines the ability to read, understand, and derive meaning from human languages. It is crucial for applications like chatbots, translation services, and voice-activated assistants.
